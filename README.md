# Change-Data-Capture

Change data capture (CDC) is a software design pattern that tracks and captures changes to data in a database and then delivers those changes to a downstream system in real-time. CDC is a method of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) that can help organizations achieve data integrity and consistency across multiple systems. 

This Python script is designed to generate simulated financial transactions and insert them into a PostgreSQL database. It's particularly useful for setting up a test environment for Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium. The script uses the faker library to create realistic, yet fictitious, transaction data and inserts it into a PostgreSQL table.
